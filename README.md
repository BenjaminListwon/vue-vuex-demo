# Vue 2.x / vuex 2.x Demo

A little while ago I [wrote a piece](https://benjaminlistwon.com/blog/data-flow-in-vue-and-vuex/) about using vuex to manage state in a Vue 2.0 app, and how to implement a shared store on your own. This repo is the continuation of the vuex implementation, as we add modules, organize actions and mutations using files and constants, and more.

- Read the [blog post](https://benjaminlistwon.com/blog/vuex-chat-part-2/) for this demo.

## Build Setup

The repo is based off the browserify vue-cli template, so the usual npm commands apply.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# lint all *.js and *.vue files
npm run lint

# run unit tests
npm test
```
For more information see the [docs for vueify](https://github.com/vuejs/vueify).
